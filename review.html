<h2>Review<br>
    <br>
Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed</h2>
<p>As this was a sole project, I did not find trello useful.  This is because I used a short checklist on paper.</p>
<p>However if this was a shared project then I would have used Trello to communicate with other members of a team,
    <br> so as, amongst other things, other members could look at Trello, see what needs completing in case I fall ill.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Were IT tools selected appropriate </h2>
    <p>As mentioned for this particular project, I did not find Trello appropriate</p>
    <p>However I found VS code very useful compared to Notepad++, I am use to.  VS code to me is more user friendly.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of my final project </h2>
    <p>I am reasonably happy with my website, as I consider the links easy to follow and breaks the webpage section by section</p>
    <p>However I would like the look of my website to be a bit more professional looking</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Further improvements that can be made to project </h2>
    <p>The overall look of the website - so maybe more links, pictures, etc on the right hand side of the page, as  opposed to
        <br> it flowing vertically</p>
    <h2>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
    <p>I have included HTML and CSS to ensure a functioning website</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of
        productivity and efficiency</h2>
        <p>As this was a sole project, I did not find trello useful. It used to much time, that could have been spent 
            <br>devising a plan on paper, thereby freeing more time spent on working on the website.</p>

    <h2> Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
        <p>Less reliance on Trello for sole projects, use paper checklist and tick off when completed</p>

    <h2>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h2>
    <p>The next sole project, I would not use trello, also I would do links in my page first and work backwards.  
        <br>For this project I realised I needed more links as I was completing the websites.</p>
        Also I would make more use of wireframe applications.  I would need to research these for a best visual
        <br> guide, that represents the skeletal framework of my next website. </p>

    <h2>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h2>
    <p>Each time I updated my code in VS code, I saved the file and run the website to see how the website changed,
        <br>if it changed how I wanted it to change - if not fix the problem before I updated VS code again.</p> 
        <p>Also I conducted a 3rd party test, that is I requested another pair of eyes to review my website, 
            <br>providing feedback on what they liked, suggestions of how it could be improved, gauging how user 
            <br>friendly the website is</p>
