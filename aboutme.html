    <p>My name is Gerard Kenny, I have always had a passion for technology, my previous career involved a lot of problem.solving in local government. 
        <br>I have been a benefit assessor for 20 years.
    </p> 
    <p>I decided to take the plunge into web development, as it is always something I have thought about, but not had the 
        <br>courage to pursue until now.
    </p> 
    <p>I decided to come to code nation as I believe I possess a good attitude, I am dedicated and a willingness to learn.
    </p>
    <p>I believe that code nation can utilise these skills I possess, hopefully to make me business ready for web development
        <br> roles and realise my ambition.
    </p>
    <p>I have signed up for the codecademy online course to gain an understanding of web development, onlong with various 
        <br>online tutorial sites.
    </p>
    <p>My experience in benefit assessment involved a process that I think will be similar to web development.
    </p>
    <p>Learn the fundamentals of the role, build on that knowledge in conjunction with experience.
    </p>
    <p>Utilise the web development society and provide input, for problems, ways to do the job better.
    </p>
    <p>I am a big fan of Dean Martin</p>
