    <h1>About me - Gerard Kenny</h1>

    
    
    <div class="text">
    
    <p>I have always had a passion for technology, my previous career involved a lot of problem.solving in local government. 
        <br>I have been a benefit assessor for 20 years.
    </p> 
    <p>I decided to take the plunge into web development, as it is always something I have thought about, but not had the 
        <br>courage to pursue until now.
    </p> 
    <p>I decided to come to code nation as I believe I possess a good attitude, I am dedicated and a willingness to learn.
    </p>
    <p>I believe that code nation can utilise these skills I possess, hopefully to make me business ready for web development
        <br> roles and realise my ambition.
    </p>
    <p>I have signed up for the codecademy online course to gain an understanding of web development, onlong with various 
        <br>online tutorial sites.
    </p>
    <p>My experience in benefit assessment involved a process that I think will be similar to web development.
    </p>
    <p>Learn the fundamentals of the role, build on that knowledge in conjunction with experience.
    </p>
    <p>Utilise the web development society and provide input, for problems, ways to do the job better.
    </p>

    <h2 class="head">The purpose of IT in modern business
    </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
    <p>For me the purpose of IT in modern business is to evaluate and install the proper hardware and software necessary 
        <br>to keep the network functioning properly.
    </p>
    <p>Also to provide an environment for best success, whether that be profit, reach or whatever, for that business
    </p>
    <p>Companies need websites to promote and help run their establishments, also HR systems require IT services.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    </div>
   


    
    <h2>What makes a project successful?</h2>
    
 
    <p>Planning! - which incorporates drafting an overall goal or finished product before beginning work. Making 
        <br>sure a plan is realistic, breaking the full project into smaller, more manageable goals and produce a 
        <br>blueprint that you I can work from.
    </p>
    <p>Also defining a Schedule  - deadlines for each stage of planning and “final deadline”.
    </p>
    <p>This “final deadline” will be ahead of an absolute deadline so as an individual or team will be able to 
        <br> “iron out” any bugs or problems not thought about when planning the project, so as it they not be too 
        <br>late to implement .
    </p>
    <p>Once I know what actually has to be done, need a list of the things needed to achieve it.
    </p>
    <p>I will need to Identify my target audience and how I want the website to look to attract that audience.
    </p>
    <p>It is important to plan how I want my audience directed through my website. By thinking through what pages
        <br> I need and how they should be laid out, this will help to ensure, early on, the good visitor experience.</p>
   
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
   






    <div>
    <h2 class="a">Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. <br>
        How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board. 
    </h2>
    </div>

    <p>Utilise trello to be able to stay on track/reach appointed deadlines.  Therefore to do section will conceptualise the 
        <br>initial planning of the website and what needs to be done - text on the page,style of the pages, images to use.
    </p>
    <p>Doing section will highlight ongoing creation of the website, bringing attention to things that may need to be done, 
        <br>that was missed in the original conception of the website.
    </p>
    <p>Done section of Trello will nail down what has been done, so as to concentrate on what still needs to be done.
    </p>
    <p>Produce an online drawing as to how I envisage the website will look, so as to best sell myself.
    </p>
    <p>So strive for ease of use and easy on the eye for the user.
    </p>
    <p>Decide on the different elements within the page, how the page will be structured.
        Decide how users will interact with the page and move within the page/pages.
        </p>
        <p>I need to choose a website builder that fits in with the vision of how I want my website to look.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
    
        
        <h2>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
        
        <p>Misalignment between a web developer and a client: that is a website may be beautiful, with a great user experience, 
            <br>but if it overlooks, or does not 1. adequately represent how the client wants the website to look, 2. what 
            <br>information they want their target audience, to take away from the website, along with the business processes,
            <br> the website is very likely to fail. 
        </p>
        <p>Therefore a project should I believe not just rely on web developers in each stage of producing a website.</p>
        <p>There should be a crossover of skills and expertise, not just technical/IT, involved in the whole process.
        </p>
        <p>Planning is important so as to determine budget, scope and time limits of the project.
        </p>
        <br>

            <p>Research each applications
            </p> 
            <p>Will need to pick a suitable code editor so as to run the website in the vision of how I want it.
            </p>
            <p>That is see which website looks and feels the best.</p>
            <p>Also will need Trello, slack and git</p>
