<p>As this was a sole project, I did not find trello useful.  This is because I used a short checklist on paper.</p>
<p>However if this was a shared project then I would have used Trello to communicate with other members of a team,
    <br> so as, amongst other things, other members could look at Trello, see what needs completing in case I fall ill.</p>
