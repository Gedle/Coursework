      <p>For me the purpose of IT in modern business is to evaluate and install the proper hardware and software necessary 
        <br>to keep the network functioning properly.
    </p>
    <p>Also to provide an environment for best success, whether that be profit, reach or whatever, for that business
    </p>
    <p>Companies need websites to promote and help run their establishments, also HR systems require IT services.
