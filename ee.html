<p>Each time I updated my code in VS code, I saved the file and run the website to see how the website changed,
        <br>if it changed how I wanted it to change - if not fix the problem before I updated VS code again.</p> 
        <p>Also I conducted a 3rd party test, that is I requested another pair of eyes to review my website, 
            <br>providing feedback on what they liked, suggestions of how it could be improved, gauging how user 
            <br>friendly the website is</p>
