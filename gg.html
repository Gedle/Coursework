<p>The next sole project, I would not use trello, also I would do links in my page first and work backwards.  
        <br>For this project I realised I needed more links as I was completing the websites.</p>
        Also I would make more use of wireframe applications.  I would need to research these for a best visual
        <br> guide, that represents the skeletal framework of my next website. </p>
