<p>Misalignment between a web developer and a client: that is a website may be beautiful, with a great user experience, 
            <br>but if it overlooks, or does not 1. adequately represent how the client wants the website to look, 2. what 
            <br>information they want their target audience, to take away from the website, along with the business processes,
            <br> the website is very likely to fail. 
        </p>
        <p>Therefore a project should I believe not just rely on web developers in each stage of producing a website.</p>
        <p>There should be a crossover of skills and expertise, not just technical/IT, involved in the whole process.
        </p>
        <p>Planning is important so as to determine budget, scope and time limits of the project.
